I really would love to see something ADHD related with him (perhaps where he's doing something special interest related like maybe Space since I think that would be one for him). I also like Bingo and Lila, so maybe just them sharing a joyful hug would be fun and sweet. :3 I also love Socks and Muffin as well! I'm not picky with what you do, so I don't mind surprises either! :D
